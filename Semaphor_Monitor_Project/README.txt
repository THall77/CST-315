For the Semaphore Program, run these commands:

$ gcc Semaphore_Example.c -o Sem_Example -lpthread
$ ./ Sem_Example

---------------------------------------------------------

For the Monitor part, it is not to be run, exactly.
As it is a conceptual program, it's better to just look 
at it rather than run it.
