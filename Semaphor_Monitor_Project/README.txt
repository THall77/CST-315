Before running, use this command to check if you are on
the right version:

$ gcc --version

If you are not on version 9.3.0, this may not work and you
will have to update.

---------------------------------------------------------

For the Semaphore Program, run these commands:

$ gcc Semaphore_Example.c -o Sem_Example
$ ./Sem_Example

The program will go on forever, use CTRL+C to end it.

If the program does not compile, use the Semaphore_Code.txt file to 
create a .c file and run that, if you can.

---------------------------------------------------------

For the Monitor part, it also runs forever, so the same way to stop it applies.
Here are the commands I used to run it:

$ gcc Monitor_Example.c -o Mon_Ex
$ ./Mon_Ex

Same advice applies if this too doesn't work, there
will be a Monitor_Code.txt file included.
