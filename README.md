Hello Professor Citro!

You've already had me as a student, but in case you forgot,
my name is Tyler Allen Hall! I'm a Sophomore here at GCU,
and my degree is Computer Science with and Emphasis in
Game and Simulation Development. I'm also in your CST-305 class,
and I'm really happy to get you again as a professor.

My hobbies are programming (obviosly) and cooking, and I hope
that eventually I'll be able to have an independent game studio to make
video games as a career, although I'll be happy with any job that pays the
bills. So far I've really enjoyed using Linux, and can't wait to learn
more about it throughout the semester. Looking forward to learning from 
you!

Allen Hall
